A Pomodoro Clock. This web application is intended to be used as a productivity tool. The user can set the clock for how long they plan to work for, and for how long they subsequently want to take a break. An alarm will go off when the clock reaches "00:00:00".

Built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

A Free Code Camp project.

DECEMBER 2020 UPDATE: I've now migrated the JavaScript file in this project to TypeScript. It's my first time using TypeScript, and I'm really enjoying how it can flag up potential errors in my code and provide more security and structure.
