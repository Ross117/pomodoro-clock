A Pomodoro Clock. This web application is intended to be used as a productivity tool. The user can set the clock for how long they plan to work for, and for how long they subsequently want to take a break. An alarm will go off when the clock reaches "00:00:00".

Built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, along with the Bootstrap framework.

A Free Code Camp project.
